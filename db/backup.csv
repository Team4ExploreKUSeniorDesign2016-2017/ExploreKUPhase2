Adams Alumni Center,38.960401,-95.242294,Building,,"The redbrick classical-style building, designed by Kiene & Bradley Architectural Partnership of Topeka, was dedicated May 14, 1983, in the centennial year of the Alumni Association. The association had been housed in Fraser and Strong halls, Sudler House and the Kansas Union before the new center was built. An alumni fund drive raised $4.2 million for construction, and the KU Endowment Association donated a site northeast of the Kansas Union.

The building has reception areas; conference and meeting rooms; a lounge and library; a club and activity rooms for retired faculty; and administrative, programs, publications and records staff offices. The center is named in memory of K.S. \Boots\ Adams, a former student who went to work for Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Okla., in 1920 to earn enough money to complete his KU business degree and retired as chief executive officer. His widow and seven children, five of them KU alumni, were major donors. The retired faculty club is named for Paul Endacott, a 1923 engineering alumnus and basketball star who also was a key executive at Phillips. He, his wife and two sons, also alumni, donated the funds for it.

Incorporated into the building are architectural elements salvaged from Old Fraser Hall: wrought-iron railings from the towers, doors used as paneling, and balusters used as room dividers.","1266 Oread Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Allen Fieldhouse,38.954318,-95.25269,Building,,"The fieldhouse, which opened March 1, 1955, is named for Forrest C. \Phog\ Allen, longtime basketball coach who played for and was trained by James Naismith, the game's founder, a longtime KU professor of physical culture and its first basketball coach. The fieldhouse and its basketball court, now named for Naismith, superseded the facilities at the original Robinson Gymnasium, built in 1907 and razed in the late 1960s, and Hoch Auditorium, where games were played from 1927 to 1955. Like those facilities, the fieldhouse also has been the site of concerts and university functions.

The fieldhouse, a limestone structure designed by State Architect Charles L. Marshall, seats 16,300 and has concession and media facilities. It houses media relations offices; systems information; facilities and events management; baseball, rowing and Spirit Squad coaches; men's and women's track offices; an Olympic sports equipment room; locker rooms for rowing, soccer, softball and men's and women's basketball teams and staff and officials; and athletics human resources and other administrative offices.

It was renovated in 1974-75, including a new court floor, and again in 1993. In spring 2005 the exterior was cleaned and other renovations done before construction began on the two-story, 26,000-square-foot Booth Family Hall of Athletics on the east face, designed by HOK Sport+Venue+Event of Kansas City, Mo. The hall was made possible by donations from the children of Gilbert and Betty Booth, longtime KU supporters who lived near the fieldhouse. It opened Jan. 21, 2006, and houses a hall of fame for Kansas athletes and sports, with a special emphasis on the contributions of Naismith and Allen to KU’s basketball traditions. The hall also includes the ticket office;www.kustore.com; and donor, alumni and recruiting meeting rooms.

Booth Hall was expanded, including new interactive exhibits, as part of a $41-million renovation to the Fieldhouse complex completed in late 2009. The projects included a new 11,600-square-foot basketball practice facility for men and women; an enlarged volleyball facility in Horejsi; remodeled locker rooms and offices in Wagnon-Parrott for softball, soccer, track, and other sports; new locker rooms in Anschutz Pavilion; and new tutoring rooms, computer lab, and staff offices in student support services. The second floor of a new atrium linking Wagnon-Parrott with the Fieldhouse is a multifunction space adaptable for receptions and exhibitions.

In the Fieldhouse, locker rooms, restrooms, concourses and concession areas were remodeled; mechanical and electrical improvements were made; and a two-level bridge to the parking garage was added.

Construction began in fall 2014 on the DeBruce Center, which will house Naismith's original \Rules of Basket Ball\ as well as a student center and meeting rooms. The three-story, $18 million center adjoining the northeast corner of the Fieldhouse and the Booth Hall of Athletics will be named for Paul and Katherine DeBruce, 1973 alumni who are primary donors.

Naismith wrote the rules of the game he invented in December 1891. The sheets of paper, typewritten and annotated by Naismith, were purchased for $4.3 million at auction in December 2010 and donated to KU by David and Suzanne Deal Booth, alumni whose family funded the hall of athletics.","1651 Naismith Drive, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Ambler Student Recreation Fitness Center,38.952444,-95.248826,Building,,"Increasing demand for both educational and recreational sports facilities spurred the decision in the late 1990s to build a new student center.

Art & Design Building,38.957862,-95.25081,Building,,"The School of Fine Arts was founded in 1891, combining the Department of Music, established in 1877, and the Department of Art, established in 1885. Courses in drawing, painting, piano, violin, voice and other fine arts had been offered since KU's earliest years, but none of the disciplines had a permanent home. For several decades music teachers were paid by student fees, and the visual arts were taught as second or third subjects by faculty hired for other courses.

Between 1893 and 1917 the school was housed in the increasingly decrepit North College, the university's first building, until that was declared unfit for occupation. Rooms in the basement and first floor of the new Administration Building (later Strong Hall) were used by music; visual art had studios and classrooms on the top floor. By the early 1970s space in about a dozen campus buildings was being used, including Bailey Annex, Memorial Stadium, Flint Hall, Chamney House and Barn, the Wesley Building, and a duplex on 14th Street.

A long campaign for a dedicated building for at least the performing arts ended when the music and dance departments moved into the newly completed Murphy Hall in 1957. It shared performing space with the University Theatre but had its own wing for faculty studios, rehearsal rooms and administrative offices for the School of Fine Arts.

In 2009, an administrative reorganization created the School of Music, housed in Murphy Hall; and the School of the Arts, affiliated with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and comprising the departments of dance, film and media studies, theatre, and visual art. The offices for these departments remain in Art & Design and Murphy. Several design programs housed in Art & Design are now affiliated with the School of Architecture, Design and Planning.

Visual art faculty committees had begun serious planning for their own building about 1970, and funding was approved in 1975. Its design was by Paul Krause, a 1956 alumnus and principal at Horner & Krause of Kansas City, Kan., but construction estimates had to be redone to meet the budget, delaying the project. Construction began in 1977 on the hilltop south of Marvin Hall.

The new building of red brick, an open plan over steel trusses, had 115,000 square feet; it absorbed \new\ Fowler Shops, which had opened in 1949, adding about 26,600 square feet. Old mechanical engineering shops were razed to make way for the $5.75 million project, dedicated April 9, 1978.","1467 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045"

Bailey Hall,42.449209,-76.480157,Building,,"Bailey Hall, completed in 1900, was designed by John G. Haskell and built in response to surging enrollments in chemistry and pharmacy that made the 1883 Chemistry Hall (“the Shack”), also designed by Haskell, too small and outdated.

The new building was named in 1938 for E.H.S. Bailey, beloved professor (1883-1933) and department head (1883-1918), noted chemist and creator of the original “Rock Chalk” chant. He helped design the 1900 limestone structure, technically the New Chemistry Building but known from the first as “Bailey’s barn”; in 1954 the chemistry department and the School of Pharmacy moved to the new Malott Hall.

After renovations, the School of Education occupied the hall until 2001, when it moved into expanded and updated quarters in Joseph R. Pearson Hall. Bailey now houses several College of Liberal Arts & Sciences programs, including the communication studies department; African and African-American, American and European studies; African, East Asian, Latin American, and Russian, East European and Eurasian studies centers; humanities and Western civilization; and women, gender and sexuality studies.

The architect was Raymond Coolidge.

Douthart was built on the site of the original chancellor’s residence, designed by Kansas City architect Henry van Brunt, who also designed Spooner Library. After “The Outlook” became the chancellor’s residence in 1939, the home became a scholarship hall, first for men and then for women, and was named for longtime languages professor William H. Carruth.

Dyche Hall,38.95855,-95.243752,Building,,"Museum of Natural History and Biodiversity Research Center
One of KU’s signature buildings, Dyche Hall was built as the Museum of Natural History in 1901-02 to a design by Kansas City architects Walter C. Root and George W. Siemens; they used the Venetian Romanesque style characteristic of southern European churches of 1050-1200. The limestone building, distinguished by a steep-roofed tower, arched doorway and elaborate stone ornamentations of natural and fantastic animals and plants, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

After his death the building was named for Lewis Lindsay Dyche (1857-1915). Its first purpose was to house the famous Panorama of North America Mammals he created for the Kansas Pavilion at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Dyche helped design the main-floor diorama that still displays part of the collection he began while a protégé of natural history professor Francis H. Snow in the 1880s. Dyche began teaching while a KU undergraduate, earned two bachelor’s and two master’s degrees and was professor and chair of zoology and taxidermy and curator of birds and mammals. He continued collecting on expeditions throughout North America and in Greenland and the Arctic.

Included in the 1893 exposition panorama was the stuffed and mounted body of the horse Comanche, the only survivor of the U.S. Cavalry force at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876. After the horse’s death at Fort Riley in 1891, Dyche was asked to preserve it; it has remained in the museum and in 2005 was moved to a new fourth-floor climate-controlled exhibit space.

The building was closed from November 1932 to June 1941 for substantial restoration and was enlarged in 1963 and 1996.

It houses the Biodiversity Institute and the Natural History Museum administrative offices and divisions including botany, entomology, herpetology, ichthyology, informatics, vertebrate paleontology, mammalogy and ornithology.

Fraser Hall,38.957152,-95.24356,Building,,"This building of cottonwood and silverdale limestone opened March 6, 1967. It sits on the second-highest point on Mount Oread — 1,031 feet — and is visible for miles. (The highest point is 1,037 feet, between Joseph R. Pearson Hall and Carruth-O'Leary Hall on West Campus Road.) Construction began in March 1965 on the $2.2 million structure, designed by State Architect James Canole and T.R. Griest of Topeka. It is 206 by 67 feet and has eight stories; its size of 96,000 square feet is more than twice that of the beloved 1872 building whose name it retained, which was located about 50 feet west. It houses the anthropology, sociology and psychology departments; the clinical, experimental and social psychology and somatopsychology rehabilitation divisions; the Psychological Clinic; classrooms; a reading room; and faculty, staff and administrative offices.

It replaced the KU landmark built in 1872 and named in 1877 the University Building, then in 1897 Fraser Hall in honor of John Fraser, second chancellor (1867-74). That limestone building with its signature towers and red roof was designed by John G. Haskell and housed virtually all university departments, administrative offices, a chapel/theater, lecture halls, classrooms and, at various times in its basement and attic, gymnasiums.

However, within 10 years of its opening its foundations and structural soundness were causing concerns, and by the early 1960s these had become irreparably weakened and unstable. The walls had settled and cracked badly, leaks were rampant, and the ventilation and electrical systems were hopelessly outdated. In 1962 the regents, urged by Chancellor W. Clarke Wescoe, authorized Fraser’s replacement.

The design of the new hall, to be built about 50 feet east and slightly north of the original site and retaining versions of the old towers, attempted “to avoid current clichés and experimental construction” and to “express a quiet dignity and cleanness of line,” the architects stated in March 1965. Instead, it caused howls of anguish from faculty, students, alumni, other architects and state officials that continued after Old Fraser’s razing in August 1965. Architectural details such as doors, railings, balusters and other pieces were salvaged and have been used in the Kansas Union, the Adams Alumni Center and other campus structures.","1415 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045"

Lied, parents of Ernst F. Lied (d. 1980). The younger Lied attended KU 1923-25; he owned a car dealership in Omaha and was a real-estate investor in Las Vegas.

Henningson, Durham & Richardson of Omaha were the architects for the $14.6 million center, which has a 2,020-seat auditorium for musical, dance and theatrical performances, lectures and symposia; rehearsal and dance studios; ticket office; and administrative and educational offices. A $300,000 project completed in March 2011 added the Kemper Foyer of 1,800 square feet, expanding the lobby and reception and meeting spaces. The William T. Kemper Foundation financed the addition.

The Bales Organ Recital Hall, dedicated in October 1996, adjoins the center on the northwest and shares a lobby. The $1.5 million hall was built with gifts from Dane Bales, 1941 business alumni, and Polly Roth Bales, 1942 music graduate, and from the Hansen Foundation of Logan, Kan.

Its construction was delayed and complicated by World War II material shortages, which were alleviated only after Chancellor Deane W. Malott and other administrators committed the new building for military training; it was a barracks and mess hall for Army and Navy trainees until early 1946.

It was planned to house the mineral resources departments of geography, geology, chemical and petroleum engineering, mining and metallurgical engineering; the state and federal Geological Survey; and the astronomical observatory. From the mid-1970s on, engineering programs were moved to Learned and Eaton halls; the geological surveys and observatory also moved.

Marvin Hall,38.958427,-95.250251,Building,,"State Architect John F. Stanton designed this Oread limestone building, which opened in 1909 at what was then the extreme west end of campus. It was named for Frank O. Marvin, first dean of engineering (1891-1913), son of third chancellor James Marvin (1874-83) and a noted artist and musician. Engineering and architecture programs were based here and in several other campus buildings; they were consolidated as “new” Fowler Shops and other engineering workshops were built south of Marvin in ensuing decades. Learned Hall (1963) and its subsequent additions completed the process. 
 

In 1913 Goldwyn Goldsmith, who trained under Stanford White at McKim, Mead and White in New York, became first professor and head of the Department of Architecture in the School of Engineering, which was renamed the School of Engineering and Architecture in 1927.

After Learned Hall opened to house engineering programs, the architecture faculty remained in Marvin, and the School of Architecture and Urban Design was created in 1968; it was renamed Architecture and Urban Planning in 2007. In an administrative reorganization in 2009, several design departments from the defunct School of Fine Arts were incorporated into this school, and it was renamed the School of Architecture, Design and Planning.

By the mid-1970s new facilities had become imperative, and the decision was made to renovate Marvin. Gould Evans Associates of Lawrence, whose principals, Robert Gould and David Evans, are 1967 architecture alumni, was selected for the award-winning renovation that cost $2.8 million. It incorporated conference rooms and studios, classrooms, faculty and staff offices, and the dean’s office; some studios, craft shops and jury rooms are in Snow Hall. When the building was rededicated April 17, 1982, it was renamed for both Marvins, father and son.

In summer 2014, the Marvin Hall Forum, a $2.1 million, glass-clad addition to the rear of the second floor, was completed. It stands one story above ground level on concrete columns and comprises a commons space and an area for presentations that will seat 120. The addition’s walls are two layers of glass separated by about 3 feet to aid in heating and cooling; large, repositionable vertical louvers will be used to control the amount of light in the space. It was done by Studio 804, the School of Architecture’s design/build class, and paid for by private funds.","1465 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045"

McNown.

From the first known as “the Mud Hut,” it was a studio for engineering and fine arts students, and KANU/KFKU radio stations went on-air from studios there in 1952, after which it was known as Broadcasting Hall. The cryogenics laboratory there had two explosions in the summer of 1959, so it was moved to undeveloped west campus land. 

After engineering students moved to Learned Hall in 1963, textile weaving and silversmithing students retained studio space.

Memorial Carillon and Campanile,38.960005,-95.246979,Building,,"A badly needed fieldhouse was among the proposals for a commemoration to honor members of the university community and alumni who died in World War II. Chancellor Deane Malott and others were determined to build a structure that was purely a memorial and was not designed to fill a need of the university, as had been done after World War I with the stadium and the union.

A bell tower was decided on, and a fund drive began as World War II ended. The campanile was dedicated May 27, 1951. Engraved on tablets in the Memorial Room at the campanile's base are the names of 277 KU alumni, students, faculty and staff who died in World War II. The ornamental bronze doors are by sculptor Bernard “Poco” Frazier.

Designed by architect Homer F. Neville, a student in the 1920s, and Edward B. Delk, the bell tower is 120 feet high and built of Kansas limestone. The carillon, played by keyboard-operated hammers, has 53 bells cast by an English foundry established in the 1360s. The bells chime the quarter hours and hours; concerts are performed by the university carillonneur, students and guest artists.

Memorial Stadium,38.963616,-95.246464,Building,,"9 floors, basement

In 1889 students and faculty members organized the University Athletic Board to oversee competition in football, baseball and tennis with nearby colleges. KU’s games were played on fields at a city park on Massachusetts Street, and the board began trying to raise interest in a university stadium and a gymnasium. After Col. John James McCook, a Harvard-educated New York lawyer, gave the commencement address in 1890 and watched a faculty-student baseball game at the park, he donated $2,500 for a university playing field.

The university bought 12 acres in a gully northwest of the small campus from Lawrence founder and former Kansas Gov. Charles Robinson, and grading and construction began in spring 1892 on a regulation field running east-west and surrounded by a fence. The first football game at McCook Field was played Oct. 27, 1892, watched by spectators on the sidelines and in an 800-seat grandstand that was gradually expanded to seat about 10,000. A nearby hall was a dressing room for home and visiting teams.

By 1920 the facilities were rundown and inadequate, and Director of Athletics Forrest C. “Phog” Allen toured several other universities to gather ideas for a new facility. This coincided with the desire for a building or other facility to honor the 130 students and faculty members who died in World War I, including Lt. William T. Fitzsimons, an alumnus and doctor who was the first American officer killed in action.

The Million Dollar Drive fund-raising campaign began Nov. 18, 1920, just after KU’s football team — coached by Allen for this one year — came from behind to tie Nebraska 20-20. Invigorated by this amazing feat, students and others donated nearly $225,000 within a few weeks, and plans were made for a stadium, a student union and a statue commemorating “Uncle Jimmy” Green, the longtime law school dean who had died in 1919.

Allen liked the horseshoe-shaped stands, football field and track at Princeton University, and LaForce Bailey, professor of architecture, and Clement C. Williams, professor of civil engineering, designed a similar dual-purpose stadium. On May 10, 1921, about 4,000 male students and faculty tore down the rickety McCook stands and fence, and Chancellor E.H. Lindley broke ground for the new field, which ran north-south. The stadium was dedicated Nov. 11, 1922, before kickoff of the Kansas-Nebraska football game (Nebraska won 28-0). In April 1923, the first Kansas Relays, an invitational track and field event, were held.

Two seating sections were added to the original six in 1925, and in 1927 the “horseshoe” on the north end was added, covering the site of McCook Field and making the capacity 35,000.

Large spaces underneath the stands were used to house students immediately after World War II and later as art studios. In the 1960s additions to the stands raised the seating capacity to 51,500. In 1969 the track was named for Jim Hershberger, a track star, 1953 alumnus and university donor who is a member of the KU Athletic Hall of Fame. He donated $125,000 to replace the original cinders with an artificial surface. In 1970 artificial turf replaced the original grass field. 

In 1997 a two-year, $26 million renovation designed by Glenn Livingood Pezler Architects of Lawrence and HOK Sports of Kansas City, Mo., began. Funded largely by ticket surcharges, it included a new concourse, concession stands and restrooms; permanent light standards; new home locker room; new press box and media facilities; 36 suites; new elevators; and a video board. The stadium capacity now is 50,071.

In August 2008 the $31-million Anderson Family Football Complex opened adjacent to the stadium. Its name honors major contributions to the project from Dana and Sue Anderson and their son, Justin, and his wife, Jean.

In 2006, coinciding with groundbreaking for the new complex, the stadium playing field was named in honor of prominent donor Tom Kivisto of Tulsa, Okla. A former energy executive, Kivisto was a member of the KU basketball team from 1970 to 1974; earned academic All-American, All-Big Eight and academic All-Big Eight honors; and holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from KU.","1101 Maine St, Lawrence, KS 66045"

Between 1893 and 1917 the school was housed in the increasingly decrepit North College, the university's first building, until it was declared unfit for occupation.

Rooms in the basement and first floor of the new Administration Building (later Strong Hall) were used by music; visual art had studios and classrooms on the top floor. The theatre department performed in Old Fraser’s auditorium, and its organ was used for recitals. Hoch Auditorium also was used for concerts and theatre performances. By the early 1970s Bailey Annex, Memorial Stadium, Flint Hall, Chamney House and Barn, the Wesley Building and a duplex on 14th Street also were used by music and art students.

A long campaign for a dedicated building for the performing arts culminated in 1957, when the music and dance departments moved into the new Murphy Hall. It is named for Franklin Murphy, chancellor 1951-60 and a generous patron of the arts. The yellow-buff brick and crab-orchard limestone building was designed by Brinkman & Hagan of Emporia and dedicated Nov. 10, 1957.

It consolidated studio, rehearsal and performance space; costume and stage shops; a recording studio; music therapy labs; and faculty and staff offices for the music, dance and theater departments. The administrative offices for the School of Fine Arts were also in Murphy.

In 2009, an administrative reorganization created the School of Music, housed in Murphy Hall; and the School of the Arts, affiliated with the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences and comprising the departments of dance, film and media studies, theatre and visual art. The offices for these departments remain in Art & Design or Murphy. Several design programs are now affiliated with the School of Architecture, Design and Planning but remain housed in the art building.

In the 1960s funds were raised privately and from affiliated denominations for construction of a new building, and Myers was demolished in 1966.

This building was designed by architect Charles L. Marshall of Topeka and named for Irma I. Smith of Macksville, Kan., a major donor. To incorporate images from the university seal, Marshall designed the large stained-glass window “Burning Bush” and a courtyard for a large bronze statue of Moses.

Snow, the natural history professor who became the fifth chancellor (1890-1901). The original building had seriously deteriorated by 1915 and was a lethal risk by the mid-1920s when funds were finally approved for a new science building. “Old Snow,” whose site was the northwest corner of the Watson Library lawn, was demolished in 1934. Salvaged stone was used to face the Military Science Building.

State Architect Charles Cuthbert and H.H. Lane of the zoology department collaborated to design the new Indiana limestone building in a modified Collegiate Gothic style.

Both were funded by an 1891 bequest of Boston leather merchant and philanthropist William B. Spooner, uncle of Francis H. Snow, an original faculty member and the fifth chancellor. Dedicated in October 1894, it was the library until 1924, when the much larger Watson Library opened.

In 1926 it became the Spooner-Thayer Museum of Art, housing collections that were a 1917 gift of Sallie Casey Thayer in memory of her late husband, Kansas City department-store magnate William B. Thayer of Emery, Bird, Thayer. These collections included ceramics, glassware, textiles and Asian paintings. In 1978, the artwork was moved to the new Spencer Museum of Art.

It occupies a historic campus site. Charles Robinson, a founder of Lawrence and first governor of Kansas, sold the property to grocer H.W. Baker, who built a 24-room house that in 1890 he sold to fellow Quantrill raid survivor Brinton Webb Woodward, owner of Round Corner Drugs. Woodward enlarged the house, adding a notable art gallery, and named the house and grounds Brynwood Manor. 

At the end of World War I, the Acacia Fraternity bought the house and property but by 1939 could no longer maintain them. They were acquired by Olin Templin of the Endowment Association, who had long hoped to develop scholarship halls for men like Watkins and Miller women’s halls. The house was refurbished and opened as Templin Hall, a scholarship residence for 38 men, in fall 1940; it and Battenfeld Hall were the first of several scholarship halls at Alumni Place, as the Woodward property was renamed. Templin housed men, women and, during World War II, Navy officer trainees; it was demolished in 1959.

St. Louis architect Montrose Pallen McArdle was hired to design the building that Strong and the regents hoped would be “the center of the University architecture as well as the University life.” State Architect John Stanton, art professor William A. Griffith and College Dean Olin Templin advised. McArdle’s grandiose, $500,000 Classical Renaissance design had pillars, a rotunda, an art gallery and a classical museum. The Legislature balked, and the plans were scaled back, although echoes of the original exist; it now has a Classical Revival style.

Construction began on the east wing of the Administration Building in 1909; it was occupied by seven departments in 1911. Because of budget constraints, “West Ad” and “Center Ad” were completed in stages, ending in January 1924.

The Wagnon facility was built in 1992 and renovated in 1995 and 2005. It houses the offices of the athletics director, men’s and women’s basketball coaches; Olympic sports coaches, including swimming, tennis, softball, soccer, volleyball, golf, and rowing; Olympic sports equipment room; locker rooms for soccer, softball, male coaches, and female coaches; and the Dean Nesmith Training Room.

Watkins Home,38.955821,-95.244229,Building,,"In 1937 Elizabeth M. Watkins donated funds for a residence hall for nurses working at Watkins Memorial Hospital, immediately north; it served that purpose until 1974. The stone building was designed by State Architect Raymond Coolidge. It housed the Hall Center for the Humanities from 1984 to 2005. The School of Social Welfare now uses the facility for several programs.","1540 Sunflower Road, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Watkins Memorial Health Center,38.953819,-95.24845,Building,,"By the 1960s, the university had outgrown Watkins Memorial Hospital, opened in January 1932. The hospital, the gift of Elizabeth Miller Watkins and named for her late husband, could not be expanded because of its hillside site, so a larger, more modern hospital was planned for the playing fields southeast of Robinson Center. George Hampton & Associates of Wichita and State Architect Kenneth R. McCain designed the dark brick building with medical director Raymond A. Schwegler. It cost $3.65 million, paid largely by student fees, and retained the original name.

Its 60,000 square feet included 34 inpatient beds; a clinic; a laboratory and X-ray facilities; a pharmacy; allergy and immunization, physical therapy and psychiatric treatment areas; and administrative and business offices. The Ralph I. Canuteson Memorial Library is named for the first student health director (1928-65). In 1988 the facility’s name was changed to Watkins Memorial Health Center.

A major expansion and renovation costing $5.6 million, designed by Lawrence R. Good & Associates of Lawrence and completed in 1997, created more physicians’ examining rooms, a gynecology clinic, a men’s clinic, and an urgent care clinic. The health center offers treatment and educational programs in general medicine, sports medicine, nutrition, allergy management, physical therapy, immunizations and radiology. A wellness resource center offers education and support in nutrition, fitness, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior, and stress management. 

A portion of a mural of sunflowers and Jayhawks created by Marjorie Whitney, a 1929 alumna and longtime chair of the design department, was salvaged from old Watkins and mounted in the new building. Furnishings she designed, including an original bed and screens, are exhibited, as are other memorabilia.","1200 Schwegler Drive, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Watkins Scholarship Hall,38.956806,-95.242803,Building,,"In 1925, Elizabeth Miller Watkins gave $75,000 to fully fund the first KU women’s scholarship hall, to be named for her late husband, Lawrence banker Jabez B. Watkins. She also donated the land for it, on Lilac Lane adjacent to her home, “The Outlook.” The residents had to demonstrate financial need and academic ability and agree to share all domestic duties. Thomas Williamson designed the yellow-brick, colonial-style hall. The seven kitchen/dining areas in the basement were shared by seven women each; the hall also has a living room, sleeping porches and study rooms. It houses 49 women.","1506 Lilac Lane, Lawrence, KS 66044"
Watson Library,38.956574,-95.244772,Building,,"Opened Sept. 11, 1924, this Collegiate Gothic-style limestone building was named for Carrie M. Watson, an 1877 and 1880 alumna who was university librarian 1887-1921. It was designed by George L. Chandler and State Architect Ray L. Gamble. Five structural additions were done between 1938 and 1963; chronic crowding and disorganization began to be alleviated by the completion of Spencer Research Library in 1968 and Anschutz Library in 1989.

Watson now houses collections in social sciences, humanities, education, journalism and social welfare; administrative and processing offices; conservation laboratory; and computer classrooms.

The lawn in front of the library was the site of the first Snow Hall, dedicated Nov. 16, 1886, and torn down in 1933.","1425 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Wescoe Hall,38.957397,-95.247764,Building,,"In the 1960s Chancellor W. Clarke Wescoe (1960-69) began lobbying for a central humanities classroom/office building that would unite departments scattered all over campus. By 1969, Haworth Hall and its neighbor Robinson Gymnasium, both opened before 1910 in the heart of campus, were razed in preparation for the new building.

Initially a Wichita architecture firm planned a 25-story building with parking; lack of money and the loss of federal funding made a less imposing structure necessary. The architectural firm of Horst, Terrill & Karst of Topeka designed a four-story, cast-concrete modernist building set into the hillside. In the two years the site stood empty, it was dubbed “Wescoe Hole” and was a meeting place for, among others, Vietnam War protestors. Construction began in May 1971 and the first classes were offered in fall 1973. The $7.8 million hall, named for Wescoe, was dedicated April 20, 1974.

It houses about 60 classrooms; lecture halls named for College of Liberal Arts & Sciences Dean George R. Waggoner and Graduate School Dean William P. Albrecht; 300 faculty offices; nine liberal-arts departments — English, history, philosophy, classics, French and Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, and East Asian, Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures;  the School of Public Affairs & Administration; the Ermal Garinger Academic Resource Center; and the Wescoe Terrace Food Court.

Projects since 2008 have repaired and modernized the hall’s mechanical systems, remodeled offices and classrooms in the east wing, and installed energy-saving lighting systems and new ventilation systems. A 24,000-square-foot remodeling of the southwest side of Wescoe enclosed two floors of terraces and created about 80 offices and meeting rooms for the departments of history and Spanish & Portuguese.","1445 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Wesley Building,38.959744,-95.242075,Building,,"In September 1954 the Wesley Foundation Student Center opened in a brick and concrete building funded by the United Methodist Church and private donors. Like Myers Hall immediately to the west, it was organized to provide religious, educational and cultural support to university students. It had an auditorium and stage; a chapel; meeting and recreation rooms; lounges; a kitchen; offices; and a three-bedroom apartment for a resident director. In the late 1960s it was also used for design studios, art classes, and faculty and staff offices.

In 1972 the building and grounds were renovated and opened in August as the Hilltop Child Development Center; this day-care center was a direct response to demands by activists for better support services for women faculty, staff and students. To help regularize the center’s finances, the university bought the Wesley Building in 1977. Hilltop moved to a new, larger building near the Burge Union in August 2000.

University Relations had been housed next door to the south in the former Faculty Club/Oread Training High School since January 1976, when the Endowment Association moved from that building to Youngberg Hall in west campus. In 2001, University Relations took over the Wesley Building after Hilltop vacated it. The former Faculty Club building was razed in 2013.

University Relations was created in 1974 by merging the public-relations/speechwriting division of the chancellor's staff; the News Bureau, established in 1899 and until the 1940s overseen by the Department of Journalism,; and the Photo and Graphic Arts Bureau. Now Marketing Communications, it is part of the Office of Public Affairs, established in 2011. Its editorial, creative, digital media and interactive media services provide viewbooks, brochures and newsletters; faculty/staff publications; the university calendar; and university Web design and features.

News & Media Relations, also part of Public Affairs, provides news and feature stories, photographs, and video and audio reports to newspapers, radio and TV stations, and students’ hometown newspapers.","1314 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045"
Crawford Community Center,38.958476,-95.241461,Building,,"The 1892 home of Juanita Strait, bequeathed to KU Endowment at her death in 2002, was refurbished as a community center for the scholarship halls that surround it and an office and apartment for the scholarship-halls complex director. Mrs. Strait, a longtime piano teacher, was the widow of Reginald Strait, a physical education professor, and she had befriended many scholarship-hall students. 

Renovations included new plumbing, wiring, roof, siding, windows and porches; and a patio and fountain. These are funded by a $300,000 gift from Tom and Jann Crawford Rudkin, KU alumni from Sunnyvale, Calif., who lived in scholarship halls while students. The center was named for Jann Rudkin’s mother, Wilna “Willie” Crawford, at its dedication April 21, 2007.","Lawrence, KS 66044"
Youngberg Hall,38.951578,-95.265605,Building,,"Designed by Neville, Sharp & Simon of Kansas City and completed in 1960, this brick building originally housed the Center for Research in Engineering Science, which became the Center for Research Inc. in 1962. From January 1976 to April 1998 it housed KU Endowment, which built it and owns it, and it is named for Irvin E. Youngberg, a 1942 alumnus and the association’s executive secretary 1948-75. 

The KU Center for Research moved back to Youngberg Hall from Nichols, Strong and Carruth-O’Leary halls. Youngberg Hall now houses the office of the vice chancellor for Research & Graduate Studies; and financial, legal, information, employment and various program administrators and staff.","2385 Irving Hill Road, Lawrence, KS 66045"
